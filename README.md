# Image Classification with Machine Learning

This project is a Python-based application designed to classify images into predefined categories using machine learning techniques. The application leverages both **Lasso Regression** and **Random Forest** algorithms to build robust and accurate models.

### Key Features:
- **Modeling**: Implements Lasso Regression for feature selection and Random Forest for classification, ensuring a balance between simplicity and accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Generates visual representations of selected image features, aiding in the interpretability of model decisions.
- **Ease of Use**: The code is well-documented and structured for easy understanding and modification.

### Getting Started:
1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Image-Classification-ML.git`
2. **Install dependencies**: Ensure that you have the required Python packages installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Run the application**: Use `python main.py` to start classifying images with the pre-built models.

### Future Enhancements:
- Integration of additional machine learning algorithms to improve classification accuracy.
- Expansion of the dataset to include more diverse image categories.
- Implementation of a user-friendly GUI for easier interaction with the application.
